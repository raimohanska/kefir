h2#active-state Active state

p.
  Each stream or property at any given time may be in one of two states â€”
  active or inactive. When an observable is in an inactive state, it does not emit any
  events, and does not subscribe to it's original source.
  Observables automatically become active when first listener is added,
  and become inactive when last listener is removed.

p.
  For example #[tt stream = Kefir.fromEvent(el, 'click')] won't
  immediately subscribe to #[tt 'click'] event on #[tt $('.foo')],
  it will subscribe only when the first listener will be added to the
  #[tt stream]. And it will automatically unsubscribe when the last listener
  will be removed from the #[tt stream].

pre
  :escapehtml
    var stream = Kefir.fromEvent(el, 'click');
    // at this moment event listener to _el_ not added

    stream.onValue(someFn);
    // now 'click' listener added to _el_

    stream.offValue(someFn);
    // and now it is removed again

p.
  If one observable depends on another,
  its active state propagates to its dependencies.
  For example, in the following code,
  #[b mapA] will activate #[b A],
  #[b filterMapA] will activate #[b mapA] and #[b A],
  #[b mergeAB] will activate #[b A] and #[b B].

pre
  :escapehtml
    var A = Kefir.emitter();
    var B = Kefir.emitter();

    var mapA = A.map(function(){ ... });
    var filterMapA = mapA.filter(function(){ ... });
    var mergeAB = Kefir.merge(A, B);

p.
  In fact active state is just a convention that is strictly
  followed in Kefir code, for better performance.
  But you are free to not follow it in your custom plugins or combinators.

p.
  <img data-emoji="point_up"> Note that the current value of a
  property won't update when that property is inactive.
  For example, we convert an #[b emitter] to a property,
  then emit some values, while the property has no subscribers (i.e. is inactive).
  In this case the property won't get those values, and it
  won't update its current value.

pre
  :escapehtml
    var emitter = Kefir.emitter();
    var property = emitter.toProperty(0);

    // 1 and 2 won't become property current value
    emitter.emit(1);
    emitter.emit(2);

    // now we activate property by subscribing to it,
    // and also check current value
    property.onValue(function(x) {  console.log(x)  }) // => 0

    // those values will become property current
    emitter.emit(3);
    emitter.emit(4);

    property.onValue(function(x) {  console.log(x)  }) // => 4

p.
  This issue applies not only to properties,
  but also to all stateful observables
  (like #[a(href='#take') take], #[a(href='#diff') diff], #[a(href='#scan') scan] etc.).
  In rare cases you might need to activate an observable by adding
  a dummy subscriber, to solve this issue. It's ok if you really need this,
  but don't overuse that pattern. For example
  #[tt obs.map(sideEffect).onEnd(function(){})] is a bad code,
  you should do #[tt obs.onValue(sideEffect)] istead.
