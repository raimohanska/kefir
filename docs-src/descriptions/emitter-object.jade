h2#emitter-object Emitter object

p.
  Emitter object is an object, that has three methods #[b emit], #[b error], and #[b end].
  It is used in several places in Kefir as a proxy to emit events to some observable.

ul
  li #[tt emiter.emit(value)] accepts one argument (any value)
  li #[tt emiter.error(error)] accepts one argument (any value)
  li #[tt emiter.end()] accepts no arguments

pre
  :escapehtml
    emitter.emit(123);
    emitter.error('Oh, snap!');
    emitter.end();
div

p.
  Do not confuse #[b emitter object] with <a href="#emitter">emitter stream</a>.
  They both have similar methods,
  but #[b emitter object] isn't actually a stream,
  it has no stream methods or functionality.
  Emitter object has only three methods, that's it.

p.
  All #[b emitter object] methods are bound to its context,
  and can be passed safely as callbacks without binding:

pre
  :escapehtml
    // instead of this
    $('.foo').on('click', emitter.emit.bind(emitter));

    // you can do just this
    $('.foo').on('click', emitter.emit);
div
