h2#about-observables Intro to Streams and Properties

p.
  Kefir supports two types of observables â€” streams and properties.
  Stream represents a stream of events. And property represents a value,
  that changes over time. The value of a property changes in response of events,
  which means that any stream may be easily converted to a property.

p.
  In practice, the only difference between two types of observables
  is that property may have a current value. The process of subscribing
  to values in both types is the same, you call the #[a(href='#on-value') onValue]
  method, passing to it a callback function. But when you subscribe
  to a property which has current value, the callback is called
  immediately (synchronously) with the current value of the property.
